this week I worked on trying to make my vision a reality. I learned that what I designed isnt intirerly what I was going to make. I learned this when I had to re design my base to fit the new wheels.


```C++
/*

*/

void setup() {
//drive to the butter//

//bend over//

//widen arms//

//close arms around butter//

//bend back up//

//drive to destination//

    
}

void loop() {
    
}

  }
```
